Built using **Flutter** and leveraging **Firebase** services, this project aims to provide a fast, modern, and seamless user experience across different operating systems. ## 🚀 Key Features Based on the project structure and technology hints: * **Multi-Platform Support:** Single codebase deployment for **Android**, **iOS**, and potentially **Windows**. * **User Authentication:** Secure user sign-up and sign-in functionality (likely powered by Firebase). * **Event Discovery:** Browse and filter upcoming, ongoing, and past events. * **Event Registration/Booking:** Seamless flow for users to register for or book tickets for an event. * **Push Notifications (Inferred):** Capability to send timely reminders or updates about events. * **Internationalization Ready:** Supports multiple languages, indicated by the localization setup (`l10n.yaml`). * **Clean Architecture:** Structured codebase following best practices for scalability and maintainability. ## 🛠️ Technologies Used The core technologies identified from the repository structure include: | Category | Technology | Notes | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | **Frontend Framework** | **Flutter** | For building a natively compiled application from a single codebase. | | **Programming Language** | **Dart** | The primary language used for all application logic. | | **Backend Services** | **Firebase** | Highly likely used for Authentication, Realtime Database/Firestore, and Storage (`firebase.json`). | | **State Management** | *[Insert State Management Package: e.g., Provider / Bloc / Riverpod]* | Crucial for handling application state efficiently. **(Update this field)** | | **Localization** | **flutter\_localizations** | For supporting multiple languages (i18n). | ## ⚙️ Getting Started ### Prerequisites You need the following tools installed on your system: 1. **Flutter SDK** (Stable channel). 2. **Dart SDK**. 3. **Code Editor** (e.g., VS Code or Android Studio with Flutter/Dart extensions). 4. A **Firebase Project** for backend configuration. ### Installation Steps 1. **Clone the Repository:** ```bash git clone [https://github.com/Mohamed-Kamal-1/event_app.git](https://github.com/Mohamed-Kamal-1/event_app.git) cd event_app ``` 2. **Configure Firebase:** * Connect the project to your Firebase Console. * Add your platform-specific configuration files: * `google-services.json` to the `android/app/` directory. * `GoogleService-Info.plist` to the `ios/Runner/` directory. 3. **Install Dependencies:** ```bash flutter pub get ``` 4. **Run the Application:** ```bash flutter run ``` ## 📸 Usage and Screenshots *** **[Insert Screenshots or GIF of the Application UI Here]** *** * *Description of the main application flow (e.g., Home Screen with event listings).* * *Description of the event details and booking process.* ## 🤝 Contributing We welcome contributions!
